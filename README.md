### Blake Smreker

I'm a Software/Systems Engineer who loves creating tools and automation that make people's workflow and development pipelines more convenient. I spend most of my time in a terminal 😏

- I am currently a Software Engineer III on the Configuration Management team
- I'm active among communities involving Go, Python, Puppet, and various tooling's help channels
- One of my main personal goals is to create an Open Source Configuration Management program for Windows and Linux

### The Loginataka

> O Nobly Born: learn, and seek within thyself. Cultivate the cunning of the Serpent and the courage of the Tiger; sup deeply from the Wisdom of those who came before thee. Hack, and hack again; grow, by trial and by error. Post thy best hacks to the Net and gain in Repute thereby. Also, O Nobly Born, be thou grave and courteous in thy speech; be helpful to those less than thee, quick to succour and slow to flame.
>
> If thou dost these things faithfully, if thou travellest with high heart and pure intention, soon shall thy callow Newbiehood be shed. By degrees imperceptible to thyself shalt thou gain Power and Wisdom, Striving and Doing all the while. Gradually shall thy Puissance unfold and deepen.
>
> O Nobly Born, if thou dost all these things, thy Wizardhood shall surely come upon thee; but not of a sudden, and not until after thy arrogant Mind hath more than half Forgotten that such was its Aim. For know this --- you may not by thyself in Pride claim the Mantle of Wizardry; that way lies only Bogosity without End.
> 
> Rather must you Become, and Become, and Become, until Hackers respect thy Power, and other Wizards hail thee as a Brother or Sister in Wisdom, and you wake up and realize that the Mantle hath lain unknown upon thy Shoulders since you knew not when.
 
If you ask yourself, "what is the path towards wizardhood?", please read the [Loginataka](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html), one of the sacred texts.
